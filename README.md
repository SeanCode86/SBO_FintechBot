# SBO_FintechBotðŸ§­

**SBOFintechBotðŸ§­** is a Bot developed with the Telegram Bot-HTTP API, whereby it works with the Telegram Cloud and on it's main messaging app.
It is bullt with Python, using a Python wrapper/s of the API and has a number of features I perosnally use. It is also my own bot, I use to help me better understand the Computer Science of Cryptography. 

I use to it check crypto currency prices and derivatives, using CoinGecko API, as well as securities, utilizing Twelve Data API. The bot is an ongoing
little project of mine, and it will always be something I work on for my own personal use. It did have what I dubb a "Micro-Smartchain", whereby it
did produced "Block-Produced" Smart Contracts. I have since deleted that code within the script, as I was tweaking around with it too much, and it landed up being a buggy mess. I will reintroduce the concept, as I think I have found a nice library to make it work better. The idea behind this "micro-smartchain", is to create an in-app wallet type of thing like a credit or debit card, and for it to work within the Telegram Messaging App. It is just a prototype I am building to better understand the general consensus of the blockchain, cryptocurrency and to see if it can work within a messaging app. It is also a educational medium I use, whereby I use it to store documents like pdf's, etc. That section of the bot connects to my Google Drive, and I use
elements of the Bot API to retrieve what I store on the Cloud-based app from Google. It also has a primative AI sentiment classifier, processing and tokenizing language processing to that of sentiment across broader social media

**The Bot is an ongoing work-in-progress!**
